## Arangodb Proof-of-Concept

### Introduction

This is a proof-of-concept to showcase persistence and retrieving of data using [arangodb](https://www.arangodb.com/)

### Tools

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [ArangoJS](https://github.com/arangodb/arangojs)

### Setup

1. Ensure you have arangodb installed on your computer if you do not already have it. Visit [the official download page for arangodb](https://www.arangodb.com/download/) to install for your operating system
2. Clone repoitory and run `npm i` to install all packages.
3. Run `node index.js` to run the program to persist and retrieve data from arangodb

### Todo

- Run benchmark for the size of data for the reasonable response time taken to read and persist data.
